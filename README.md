JavaScript (abbreviated as JS) is an interpreted, structured, high-level scripting programming language with weakly dynamic typing and multiparadigm (prototyping, object-oriented, imperative, and functional). Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main technologies on the World Wide Web.

JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is therefore an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites do, and all major browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to run it.

In this repository will be stored from simple scripts exemplifying some logic to something more elaborate.
